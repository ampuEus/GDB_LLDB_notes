Linux: gdb

MacOS: lldb

# Quick start
```c
// use -g on compilation
gcc -g example.c

// run gdb
gdb ./a.out
```
>On compilation time **-g** flas is neaded, it means you can see the proper names of variables and functions in your stack frames, get line numbers and see the source as you step around in the executable.
